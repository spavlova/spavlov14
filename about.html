<h1>The Journey</h1>
<h5 align="center">For a while now, I have been thinking of starting a blog. When I say while, I mean maybe its been about 10 years now, and I finnally did it! 
If you're wondering how... well, I decided to take a "Web Design Class", so I had to create a website as an assignment. Basically, I put myself in a situation where I knew I would have to do it. So here it is, I hope you enjoy it!</h5>
